"any of your Mad Mimi webforms right into your site. Setup is easy. Below, simply "
"enter your account email address and API key (found in your Mad Mimi account "
"[%1$s] area). Here are the 3 ways you can display a webform on your site:</p>\n"
"\t\t\t\t<ul>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Widget:</strong> Go to Appearance &rarr; widgets and find "
"the widget called “Mad Mimi Form” and drag it into the widget area of your "
"choice. You can then add a title and select a form!</li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Shortcode:</strong> You can add a form to any post or page "
"by adding the shortcode (ex. [madgem id=80326])  in the page/post editor</li>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Template Tag:</strong> You can add the following template "
"tag into any WordPress file: <code>%2$s</code>. Ex. <code>%3$s</code></li>\n"
